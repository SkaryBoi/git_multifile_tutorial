# .gitignore files tell Git what directories to ignore when adding files to a commit
# References start from root (usually the directory with main.py in it)
# Check https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore for the full list of .gitignore syntax


# Here we want to ignore the files generated by Visual Studio, as they're junk-
# -and don't serve any purpose for fellow developers (or the end user)

# These ignores prevent these files from going into Git.
.vs
*.sln

# We also don't want the __pycache__ folder, as it's also junk generated upon compilation.
